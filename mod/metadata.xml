    Displays Tainted Lazarus' flipped (non-active) variant's stats next to the current version's stats.

[i]Speed and damage values with birthright are not their modified values.[/i]

Birthright: Speed and damage after card-use will be wrong because there is no access right before the card is used, i.e. no PRE_USE_CARD callback.

Calculations cannot be done based on the flipped or pre-flipped value because of a damage minimum and speed maximum that make it unreliable.

Non-Birthright: Stat changes that are room-duration effects (Lusty Blood) persist in the player stats as that value until the character is flipped backed to when they are updated.
If there are bugs or suggestions for improvements, please post them on the steam page or https://github.com/Fjara-h/isaac-tainted-laz-alt-stats/issues

Thanks the creators of Planetarium Chance as I used their mod as a base for my own.
