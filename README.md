A mod for The Binding of Issac: Repentance to display Tainted Lazarus' flipped (non-active) variant's stats next to the current version's stats. With birthright, the text will be slightly more visible.


***
###Notes
_Speed and damage values with birthright are not their modified values._

Birthright: Speed and damage after card use will be wrong because they can't be stored pre-card use with no PRE_USE_CARD callback. Calculations cannot be done because there is a damage minimum and speed max that hinder their reliability.

Non-Birthright: Stat changes that are room-duration effects (Lusty Blood) persist in the player stats as that value until the character is flipped backed to when they are updated.
